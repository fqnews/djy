<p>　　　　　　　　　　　　　第 18 章(下)</p>
<p>她于是换了一个话题，使她们俩都能谈得更称心。她们俩在这方面的意见是完全一致的。伊莉莎白高兴地听着吉英谈起，她在彬格莱先生身上虽然不敢存奢望，却寄托着多少幸福的心愿；她于是尽心竭力说了多少话来增加姐姐的信念。一会儿，彬格莱先生走到她们这里来了，伊莉莎白便退到卢卡斯小姐身边去。卢卡斯小姐问她跟刚才那位舞伴跳得是否愉快，她还没有来得及回答，只见柯林斯先生走上前来，欣喜欲狂地告诉她们说，他真幸运，发现了一件极其重要的事。 </p>
<p>　　他说：&#8221;这真是完全出于我意料之外，我竟然发现这屋子里有一位是我女施主的至亲。我凑巧听到一位先生跟主人家的那位小姐说，他自己的表妹德?包尔小姐和他的姨母咖苔琳夫人。这些事真是太巧合了！谁想到我会在这次的舞会上碰到咖苔琳?德?包尔夫人的姨侄呢！谢天谢地，我这个发现正是时候，还来得及去问候他吧。我根本就不知道有这门亲戚，因此还有道歉的余地。&#8221;你打算去向达西先生自我介绍吗？&#8221;我当然打算去。我一定去求他原谅，请他不要怪我没有早些问候他。我相信他是咖苔琳夫人的姨侄。我可以告诉他说，上星期我还见到她老人家，她身体着实健康。&#8221; </p>
<p>　　伊莉莎白竭力劝他不要那么做，她说，他如果不经过人家介绍就去招呼达西先生，达西先生一定会认为他冒昧唐突，而不会认为他是奉承他姨母，又说双方根本不必打交道，即使要打交道，也应该由地位比较高的达西先生来跟他通候。柯林斯先生听她这么说，便显出一副坚决的神气，表示非照着自己的意思去做不可，等她说完了，他回答道：亲爱的伊莉莎白小姐，你对于一切的问题都有卓越的见解。我非常敬佩，可是请你听我说一句：俗人的礼节跟教士们的礼节大不相同。请听我说，我认为从尊严方面看来，一个教士的位置可以比得上一个君侯，只要你能同时保持相当的谦虚。所以，这一次你应该让我照着我自己的良心的吩咐，去做好我认为应该做的事情。请原谅我没有领受你的指教，要是在任何其他的问题上，我一定把你的指教当作座右铭，不过对于当前这个问题，我觉得，由于我还算读书明理，平日也曾稍事钻研，由我自己来决定比由你这样一位年轻小姐来决定要合适些；&#8221;他深深鞠了一躬，便离开了她，去向达西先生纠缠。于是她迫不及待地望着达西先生怎样对待他这种冒失行为，料想达西先生对于这种问候方式一定要大为惊讶，只见她这位表兄先恭恭敬敬地对达西鞠了一躬，然后再开口跟他说话。伊莉莎白虽然一句也没听到他说些什么，却又好象听到了他所有的话，因为从他那蠕动嘴唇的动作看来，他无非口口声声尽说些&#8221;道歉&#8221;、&#8221;汉斯福&#8221;、&#8221;咖苔琳?德?包尔夫人&#8221;之类的话。她看到表兄在这样的一个人面前出丑，心中好不气恼。达西先生带着毫不掩饰的惊奇目光斜睨着他，等到后来柯林斯先生唠叨够了，达西才带着一副敬而远之的神气，敷衍了他几句。柯林斯先生却并不因此而灰心扫兴，一再开口。等他第二次开口唠叨的时候，达西先生的轻蔑的神气显得更露骨了。他说完以后，达西先生随便拱了拱身子就走开了。柯林斯先生这才回到伊莉莎白跟前来，跟伊莉莎白说：&#8221;告诉你，他那样接待我，我实在没有理由感到不满意。达西听到我的殷勤问候，好象十分高兴。他礼貌周全地回答了我的话，甚至恭维我说，他非常佩服咖苔琳夫人的眼力，没有提拔错了人。这的确是个聪明的想法。大体上说，我很满意他。&#8221; </p>
<p>　　伊莉莎白既然对舞会再也没有什么兴味，于是几乎把全部注意力都转移她的姐姐和彬格莱先生身上去了。她把当场的情景都看在眼里，想像出了多少可喜的事情，几乎跟吉英自己感到同样的快活。她想像着姐姐做了这幢房子里的主妇，夫妇之间恩爱弥笃，幸福无比。她觉得如果真有这样一天，那么，连彬格莱的两个姐妹，她也可以尽量对她们发生好感。她看见她母亲也明明正在转着同样的念头，因此她决定不要冒险走到母亲跟前去，免得又要听她唠叨个没完。因此当大家坐下来吃饭的时候，她看到母亲的座位跟他隔得那么近，她觉得真是受罪。只见母亲老是跟那个人（卢卡斯太太）在信口乱说，毫无忌讳，而且尽谈些她怎样盼望吉英马上跟彬格莱先生结婚之类的话，这叫伊莉莎白越发气恼。她们对这件事越谈越起劲，班纳特太太一个劲儿数说着这门姻缘有多少多少好处。首先彬格莱先生是那么漂亮的一个青年，那么有钱，住的地方离她们只有三英里路，这些条件是令人满意的。其次，他的两个姐妹非常喜欢吉英，一定也象她一样地希望能够结成这门亲，这一点也很令人快慰。再其次，吉英的亲事既然攀得这么称心如意，那么，几个小女儿也就有希望碰上别的阔人。最后再说到她那几个没有出嫁的女儿，关于她们的终身大事，从此也可以委托给大女儿，不必要她自己再为她们去应酬交际了，于情于理，这都是一件值得高兴的事，怎奈班纳特太太生平就不惯于守在家里。她又预祝卢卡斯太太马上也会有同样的幸运，其实也明明是在趾高气扬地料定她没有这个福份。 </p>
<p>　　伊莉莎白一心想要挫挫她母亲的谈锋，便劝她谈起得意的事情来要放得小声小气一点，因为达西先生就坐在她们对面，可见得大部分的话都让他听到了。可是劝也无用，她的母亲只顾骂她废话，她真是说不出的气恼。我倒请问你，达西先生与我有什么关系，我干吗要怕他？我没有理由要在他面前特别讲究礼貌，难道他不爱听的话我就不能说吗？&#8221;看老天分上，妈妈，小声点儿说吧。你得罪了达西先生有什么好处？你这样做，他的朋友也不会看得起你的。&#8221; </p>
<p>　　不过，任凭她怎么说都没有用。她的母亲偏偏要大声发表高见。伊莉莎白又羞又恼，脸蛋儿红了又红。她禁不住一眼眼望着达西先生，每望一眼就越发证实了自己的疑虑，因为达西虽然并没有老是瞧着她的母亲，可是他一直目不转睛地在望着伊莉莎白。他脸上先是显出气愤和厌恶的表情，慢慢地变得冷静庄重，一本正经。 </p>
<p>　　后来班纳特太太说完了，卢卡斯太太听她谈得那样志得意满，自己又没个份儿，早已呵欠连连，现在总算可以来安心享受一点冷肉冷鸡了。伊莉莎白现在也算松了口气。可惜她耳朵里并没有清净多久，因为晚饭一吃完，大家就谈起要唱歌。伊莉莎白眼看着曼丽经不起人家稍微怂恿一下就答应了大家的请求，觉得很难受。她曾经频频向曼丽递眼色，又再三地默默劝告她，竭力叫她不要这样讨好别人，可惜终于枉费心机。曼丽毫不理会她的用意。这种出风头的机会她是求之不得的，于是她就开始唱起来了。伊莉莎白极其苦痛地把眼睛盯在她身上，带着焦虑的心情听她唱了几节，等到唱完了，她的焦虑丝毫没有减轻，因为曼丽一听到大家对她称谢，还有人隐约表示要她再赏他们一次脸，于是歇了半分钟以后，她又唱起了另一支歌。曼丽的才力是不适宜于这种表演的，因为她嗓子细弱，态度又不自然。伊莉莎白真急得要命。她看了看吉英，看看她是不是受得了，只见，吉英正在安安静静地跟彬格莱先生谈天。她又看见彬格莱的两位姐妹正在彼此挤眼弄眉，一面对着达西做手势，达西依旧面孔铁板。她最后对自己的父亲望了一眼，求他老人家来拦阻一下，免得曼丽通宵唱下去。父亲领会了她的意思，他等曼丽唱完了第二支歌，便大声说道：你这样尽够啦，孩子。你使我们开心得够久啦。留点时间给别的小姐们表演表演吧。&#8221; </p>
<p>　　曼丽虽然装做没听见，心里多少有些不自在。伊莉莎白为她感到不好受，也为她爸爸的那番话感到不好受，生怕自己一片苦心完全白费。好在这会儿大家请别人来唱歌了。 </p>
<p>　　只听得柯林斯先生说：&#8221;假如我侥幸会唱歌，那我一定乐意给大家高歌一曲；我认为音乐是一种高尚的娱乐，和牧师的职业丝毫没有抵触。不过我并不是说，我们应该在音乐上花上太多的时间，因为的确还有许多别的事情要做。负责一个教区的主管牧师在多少事要做啊，首先他得制订什一税的条例，既要订得于自己有利，又要不侵犯地主的利益。他得自己编写讲道辞，这一来剩下的时间就不多了。他还得利用这点儿时间来安排教区里的事务，照管和收拾自己的住宅──住宅总少不了要尽量弄得舒舒服服。还有一点我认为也很重要；他对每一个人都得殷勤和蔼，特别是那些提拔他的人。我认为这是他应尽的责任。再说，遇到施主家的亲友，凡是在应该表示尊敬的场合下，总得表示尊敬，否则是不象话的。&#8221;他说到这里，向达西先生鞠了一躬，算是结束了他的话。他这一席话说得那么响亮，半个屋子里的人都听得见。多少人看呆了，多少人笑了，可是没有一个人象班纳特先生那样听得有趣，他的太太却一本正经地夸奖柯林斯先生的话真说得合情合理，她凑近了卢卡斯太太说，他显然是个很聪明优秀的青年。 </p>
<p>　　伊莉莎白觉得她家里人好象是约定今天晚上到这儿来尽量出丑，而且可以说是从来没有那样起劲，从来没有那样成功。她觉得姐姐和彬格莱先生真幸运，有些出丑的场面没有看到，好丰彬格莱先生即使看到了一些可笑的情节，也不会轻易感到难受。不过他的两个姐妹和达西先生竟抓住这个机会来嘲笑她家里人，这已经是够难堪的了，那位先生的无声的蔑视和两个娘儿们的无礼的嘲笑，究竟哪一样更叫人难堪，她可不能断定。 </p>
<p>　　晚会的后半段时间也没有给她带来什么乐趣。柯林斯先生还是一直不肯离开她身边，和她打趣。虽然他无法请她再跟他跳一次舞，可是却弄得她也无法跟别人跳。她要求他跟别人去跳，并且答应给他介绍一位小姐，可是他不肯。他告诉她说，讲到跳舞，他完全不发生兴趣，他的主要用意就是要小心等候她，她博得她的欢心，因此他打定主意整个晚上待在她身边。无论怎样跟解释也没用。多亏她的朋友卢卡斯小姐常常来到他们身边，好心好意地和柯林斯先生攀谈攀谈，她才算觉得好受一些。 </p>
<p>　　至少达西先生可以不再来惹她生气了。他虽然常常站得离她很近，边上也没有人，却一直没有走过来跟她说话。她觉得这可能是因为她提到了韦翰先生的缘故，她因此不禁暗暗自喜。 </p>
<p>　　在全场宾客中，浪博恩一家人最后走，而且班纳特太太还用了点手腕，借口等候马车，一直等到大家走完了，她们一家人还多待了一刻钟。她们在这一段时间里看到主人家有些人非常指望她们赶快走。赫斯脱太太姐妹俩简直不开口说话，只是嚷着疲倦，显然是在下逐客令了。班纳特太太一开口想跟她们攀谈，就被她们拒绝了，弄得大家都没精打采。柯林斯先生尽管在发表长篇大论，恭维彬格莱先生和他的姐妹们，说他们家的宴席多么精美，他们对待客人多么殷勤有礼，可是他的话也没有能给大家增加一些生气。达西一句话也没有说。班纳特先生同样没做声，站在那儿袖手旁观。彬格莱和吉英站得离大家远一些，正在亲亲密密地交谈。伊莉莎白象赫斯脱太太和彬格莱小姐一样，始终不开口。连丽迪雅也觉得太疲乏了，没有说话，只是偶然叫一声：&#8221;天啊，我多么疲倦！&#8221;接着便大声打了一个呵欠。 </p>
<p>　　后来她们终于起身告辞了，班纳特太太恳切务至地说，希望在最短时间以内，彬格莱先生阖府都到浪博恩去玩，又特别对彬格莱先生本人说，要是那天他能上她们家去吃顿便饭，也不要正式下请帖，那她们真是荣幸之至。彬格莱先生欣喜异常，连忙说，他明天就要动身到伦敦去待一个短时期，等他回来以后，一有机会就去拜望她。 </p>
<p>　　班纳特太太满意极了，走出屋来，一路打着如意算盘；不出三四个月光景，她就可以看到自己的女儿在尼日斐花园找到归宿了，她少不了要准备一些财产、嫁妆和新的马车。她同样相信另一个女儿一定会嫁给柯林斯先生，对这门亲事她虽然没有对那门亲事那样高兴，可也相当高兴。在所有的女儿里面，她最不喜欢伊莉莎白。尽管姑爷的人品和门第，配她已经绰绰有余，可是比起彬格莱先生和尼日斐花园来，就显得黯然失色了。</p>
<p>　　　　　　　　　　　　　Chapter 18 (part 2)</p>
<p>She then changed the discourse to one more gratifying to each, and on which there could be no difference of sentiment. Elizabeth listened with delight to the happy, though modest hopes which Jane entertained of Bingley&#8217;s regard, and said all in her power to heighten her confidence in it. On their being joined by Mr. Bingley himself, Elizabeth withdrew to Miss Lucas; to whose inquiry after the pleasantness of her last partner she had scarcely replied, before Mr. Collins came up to them and told her with great exultation that he had just been so fortunate as to make a most important discovery. <br />&#8220;I have found out,&#8221; said he, &#8220;by a singular accident, that there is now in the room a near relation of my patroness. I happened to overhear the gentleman himself mentioning to the young lady who does the honours of this house the names of his cousin Miss de Bourgh, and of her mother Lady Catherine. How wonderfully these sort of things occur! Who would have thought of my meeting with &#8212; perhaps &#8212; a nephew of Lady Catherine de Bourgh in this assembly! &#8212; I am most thankful that the discovery is made in time for me to pay my respects to him, which I am now going to do, and trust he will excuse my not having done it before. My total ignorance of the connection must plead my apology.&#8221; <br />&#8220;You are not going to introduce yourself to Mr. Darcy?&#8221; <br />&#8220;Indeed I am. I shall intreat his pardon for not having done it earlier. I believe him to be Lady Catherine&#8217;s nephew. It will be in my power to assure him that her ladyship was quite well yesterday se&#8217;nnight.&#8221; <br />Elizabeth tried hard to dissuade him from such a scheme; assuring him that Mr. Darcy would consider his addressing him without introduction as an impertinent freedom, rather than a compliment to his aunt; that it was not in the least necessary there should be any notice on either side, and that if it were, it must belong to Mr. Darcy, the superior in consequence, to begin the acquaintance. &#8212; Mr. Collins listened to her with the determined air of following his own inclination and when she ceased speaking, replied thus, <br />&#8220;My dear Miss Elizabeth, I have the highest opinion in the world of your excellent judgment in all matters within the scope of your understanding, but permit me to say that there must be a wide difference between the established forms of ceremony amongst the laity, and those which regulate the clergy; for give me leave to observe that I consider the clerical office as equal in point of dignity with the highest rank in the kingdom &#8212; provided that a proper humility of behaviour is at the same time maintained. You must therefore allow me to follow the dictates of my conscience on this occasion, which leads me to perform what I look on as a point of duty. Pardon me for neglecting to profit by your advice, which on every other subject shall be my constant guide, though in the case before us I consider myself more fitted by education and habitual study to decide on what is right than a young lady like yourself.&#8221; And with a low bow he left her to attack Mr. Darcy, whose reception of his advances she eagerly watched, and whose astonishment at being so addressed was very evident. Her cousin prefaced his speech with a solemn bow, and though she could not hear a word of it, she felt as if hearing it all, and saw in the motion of his lips the words &#8220;apology,&#8221; &#8220;Hunsford,&#8221; and &#8220;Lady Catherine de Bourgh.&#8221; &#8212; It vexed her to see him expose himself to such a man. Mr. Darcy was eyeing him with unrestrained wonder, and when at last Mr. Collins allowed him time to speak, replied with an air of distant civility. Mr. Collins, however, was not discouraged from speaking again, and Mr. Darcy&#8217;s contempt seemed abundantly increasing with the length of his second speech, and at the end of it he only made him a slight bow, and moved another way. Mr. Collins then returned to Elizabeth. <br />&#8220;I have no reason, I assure you,&#8221; said he, &#8220;to be dissatisfied with my reception. Mr. Darcy seemed much pleased with the attention. He answered me with the utmost civility, and even paid me the compliment of saying that he was so well convinced of Lady Catherine&#8217;s discernment as to be certain she could never bestow a favour unworthily. It was really a very handsome thought. Upon the whole, I am much pleased with him.&#8221; <br />As Elizabeth had no longer any interest of her own to pursue, she turned her attention almost entirely on her sister and Mr. Bingley, and the train of agreeable reflections which her observations gave birth to, made her perhaps almost as happy as Jane. She saw her, in idea, settled in that very house, in all the felicity which a marriage of true affection could bestow; and she felt capable, under such circumstances, of endeavouring even to like Bingley&#8217;s two sisters. Her mother&#8217;s thoughts she plainly saw were bent the same way, and she determined not to venture near her, lest she might hear too much. When they sat down to supper, therefore, she considered it a most unlucky perverseness which placed them within one of each other; and deeply was she vexed to find that her mother was talking to that one person (Lady Lucas) freely, openly, and of nothing else but of her expectation that Jane would be soon married to Mr. Bingley. &#8212; It was an animating subject, and Mrs. Bennet seemed incapable of fatigue while enumerating the advantages of the match. His being such a charming young man, and so rich, and living but three miles from them, were the first points of self-gratulation; and then it was such a comfort to think how fond the two sisters were of Jane, and to be certain that they must desire the connection as much as she could do. It was, moreover, such a promising thing for her younger daughters, as Jane&#8217;s marrying so greatly must throw them in the way of other rich men; and lastly, it was so pleasant at her time of life to be able to consign her single daughters to the care of their sister, that she might not be obliged to go into company more than she liked. It was necessary to make this circumstance a matter of pleasure, because on such occasions it is the etiquette, but no one was less likely than Mrs. Bennet to find comfort in staying at home at any period of her life. She concluded with many good wishes that Lady Lucas might soon be equally fortunate, though evidently and triumphantly believing there was no chance of it. <br />In vain did Elizabeth endeavour to check the rapidity of her mother&#8217;s words, or persuade her to describe her felicity in a less audible whisper; for to her inexpressible vexation, she could perceive that the chief of it was overheard by Mr. Darcy, who sat opposite to them. Her mother only scolded her for being nonsensical. <br />&#8220;What is Mr. Darcy to me, pray, that I should be afraid of him? I am sure we owe him no such particular civility as to be obliged to say nothing he may not like to hear.&#8221; <br />&#8220;For heaven&#8217;s sake, madam, speak lower. &#8212; What advantage can it be to you to offend Mr. Darcy? &#8212; You will never recommend yourself to his friend by so doing.&#8221; <br />Nothing that she could say, however, had any influence. Her mother would talk of her views in the same intelligible tone. Elizabeth blushed and blushed again with shame and vexation. She could not help frequently glancing her eye at Mr. Darcy, though every glance convinced her of what she dreaded; for though he was not always looking at her mother, she was convinced that his attention was invariably fixed by her. The expression of his face changed gradually from indignant contempt to a composed and steady gravity. <br />At length however Mrs. Bennet had no more to say; and Lady Lucas, who had been long yawning at the repetition of delights which she saw no likelihood of sharing, was left to the comforts of cold ham and chicken. Elizabeth now began to revive. But not long was the interval of tranquillity; for when supper was over, singing was talked of, and she had the mortification of seeing Mary, after very little entreaty, preparing to oblige the company. By many significant looks and silent entreaties, did she endeavour to prevent such a proof of complaisance, &#8212; but in vain; Mary would not understand them; such an opportunity of exhibiting was delightful to her, and she began her song. Elizabeth&#8217;s eyes were fixed on her with most painful sensations; and she watched her progress through the several stanzas with an impatience which was very ill rewarded at their close; for Mary, on receiving amongst the thanks of the table, the hint of a hope that she might be prevailed on to favour them again, after the pause of half a minute began another. Mary&#8217;s powers were by no means fitted for such a display; her voice was weak, and her manner affected. &#8212; Elizabeth was in agonies. She looked at Jane, to see how she bore it; but Jane was very composedly talking to Bingley. She looked at his two sisters, and saw them making signs of derision at each other, and at Darcy, who continued however impenetrably grave. She looked at her father to entreat his interference, lest Mary should be singing all night. He took the hint, and when Mary had finished her second song, said aloud, <br />&#8220;That will do extremely well, child. You have delighted us long enough. Let the other young ladies have time to exhibit.&#8221; <br />Mary, though pretending not to hear, was somewhat disconcerted; and Elizabeth sorry for her, and sorry for her father&#8217;s speech, was afraid her anxiety had done no good. &#8212; Others of the party were now applied to. <br />&#8220;If I,&#8221; said Mr. Collins, &#8220;were so fortunate as to be able to sing, I should have great pleasure, I am sure, in obliging the company with an air; for I consider music as a very innocent diversion, and perfectly compatible with the profession of a clergyman. &#8212; I do not mean however to assert that we can be justified in devoting too much of our time to music, for there are certainly other things to be attended to. The rector of a parish has much to do. &#8212; In the first place, he must make such an agreement for tithes as may be beneficial to himself and not offensive to his patron. He must write his own sermons; and the time that remains will not be too much for his parish duties, and the care and improvement of his dwelling, which he cannot be excused from making as comfortable as possible. And I do not think it of light importance that he should have attentive and conciliatory manners towards every body, especially towards those to whom he owes his preferment. I cannot acquit him of that duty; nor could I think well of the man who should omit an occasion of testifying his respect towards any body connected with the family.&#8221; And with a bow to Mr. Darcy, he concluded his speech, which had been spoken so loud as to be heard by half the room. &#8212; Many stared. &#8212; Many smiled; but no one looked more amused than Mr. Bennet himself, while his wife seriously commended Mr. Collins for having spoken so sensibly, and observed in a half-whisper to Lady Lucas, that he was a remarkably clever, good kind of young man. <br />To Elizabeth it appeared, that had her family made an agreement to expose themselves as much as they could during the evening, it would have been impossible for them to play their parts with more spirit, or finer success; and happy did she think it for Bingley and her sister that some of the exhibition had escaped his notice, and that his feelings were not of a sort to be much distressed by the folly which he must have witnessed. That his two sisters and Mr. Darcy, however, should have such an opportunity of ridiculing her relations was bad enough, and she could not determine whether the silent contempt of the gentleman, or the insolent smiles of the ladies, were more intolerable. <br />The rest of the evening brought her little amusement. She was teazed by Mr. Collins, who continued most perseveringly by her side, and though he could not prevail with her to dance with him again, put it out of her power to dance with others. In vain did she entreat him to stand up with somebody else, and offer to introduce him to any young lady in the room. He assured her that as to dancing, he was perfectly indifferent to it; that his chief object was by delicate attentions to recommend himself to her, and that he should therefore make a point of remaining close to her the whole evening. There was no arguing upon such a project. She owed her greatest relief to her friend Miss Lucas, who often joined them, and good-naturedly engaged Mr. Collins&#8217;s conversation to herself. <br />She was at least free from the offence of Mr. Darcy&#8217;s farther notice; though often standing within a very short distance of her, quite disengaged, he never came near enough to speak. She felt it to be the probable consequence of her allusions to Mr. Wickham, and rejoiced in it. <br />The Longbourn party were the last of all the company to depart; and by a manoeuvre of Mrs. Bennet, had to wait for their carriages a quarter of an hour after every body else was gone, which gave them time to see how heartily they were wished away by some of the family. Mrs. Hurst and her sister scarcely opened their mouths except to complain of fatigue, and were evidently impatient to have the house to themselves. They repulsed every attempt of Mrs. Bennet at conversation, and by so doing, threw a languor over the whole party, which was very little relieved by the long speeches of Mr. Collins, who was complimenting Mr. Bingley and his sisters on the elegance of their entertainment, and the hospitality and politeness which had marked their behaviour to their guests. Darcy said nothing at all. Mr. Bennet, in equal silence, was enjoying the scene. Mr. Bingley and Jane were standing together, a little detached from the rest, and talked only to each other. Elizabeth preserved as steady a silence as either Mrs. Hurst or Miss Bingley; and even Lydia was too much fatigued to utter more than the occasional exclamation of &#8220;Lord how tired I am!&#8221; accompanied by a violent yawn. <br />When at length they arose to take leave, Mrs. Bennet was most pressingly civil in her hope of seeing the whole family soon at Longbourn; and addressed herself particularly to Mr. Bingley, to assure him how happy he would make them by eating a family dinner with them at any time, without the ceremony of a formal invitation. Bingley was all grateful pleasure, and he readily engaged for taking the earliest opportunity of waiting on her, after his return from London, whither he was obliged to go the next day for a short time. <br />Mrs. Bennet was perfectly satisfied; and quitted the house under the delightful persuasion that, allowing for the necessary preparations of settlements, new carriages, and wedding clothes, she should undoubtedly see her daughter settled at Netherfield in the course of three or four months. Of having another daughter married to Mr. Collins, she thought with equal certainty, and with considerable, though not equal, pleasure. Elizabeth was the least dear to her of all her children; and though the man and the match were quite good enough for her, the worth of each was eclipsed by Mr. Bingley and Netherfield.</p>
